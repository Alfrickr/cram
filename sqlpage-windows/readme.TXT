1. Install SQLPage and MySQL
2. Create a database and note down that database name and password you set in MySQL
3. Put the directory 'sqlpage-windows' onto your system downloaded from GitHub
4. Go to the 'sqlpage-windows' directory, then go into the 'sqlpage' directory, and open the 'sqlpage.json' file
5. Within the 'sqlpage.json' file, replace 'abcd' with your password and 'alejandro' with your database name you want to use
6. Save the 'sqlpage.json' file
7. Go back to the root 'sqlpage-windows' directory
8. Run 'sqlpage.exe'
9. Open a web browser
10. Type in http://localhost:8080
