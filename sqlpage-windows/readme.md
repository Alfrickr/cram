## Windows 10 Instructions (likely will work on Windows 11 too):
1. Install SQLPage and MySQL
2. Create a database and note down that database name and password you set in MySQL
3. Put the directory 'sqlpage-windows' onto your system downloaded from GitHub
4. Go to the 'sqlpage-windows' directory, then go into the 'sqlpage' directory, and open the 'sqlpage.json' file
5. Within the 'sqlpage.json' file, replace 'abcd' with your password and 'alejandro' with your database name you want to use
6. Save the 'sqlpage.json' file
7. Go back to the root 'sqlpage-windows' directory
8. Run 'sqlpage.exe'
9. Open a web browser
10. Type in http://localhost:8080 and enter it
11. You should now see SQLPage setup seeing a list of 3 clickable buttons looking like this:

After the setup:
It is suggested for you to click "Drop, Create, and Insert Into SUE1 and SUE2 Tables" before navigating to SUE1 and SUE2, but you could also recreate the tables there as well with the "Recreate SUE1 Table" or "Recreate SUE2 Table" buttons
